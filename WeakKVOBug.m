In Objective-C, a tricky bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and the use of weak references.  If an object observes another object using a weak reference, and the observed object is deallocated while the observation is still in place, this can lead to a crash. This is because the observer tries to access a property of the deallocated observed object, leading to an exception.
